# VaultDatabase
### _Now open source! :confetti_ball:_

Code live on: https://database.vaultmc.net

# Road Map:
**High to Low sorting**
- Better layout of the [statistics](https://database.vaultmc.net/statistics.php) page.
- Reusable PDO connection
- Sortable tables sitewide
  - _Pages: ~~Search page~~ **(complete!)**, User page, Clans page, Statistics page. (Maybe make it a function for easier and more centralized use?)_
- Admin mode - Edit, delete and add punishments

# Pull Requests
I am open to any and all PR's and will be reviewing them as soon as I can. 

If you feel like you can contribute to my codebase, please feel free!

##### _That's all for now folks_
